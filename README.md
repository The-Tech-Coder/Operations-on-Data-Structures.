# Operations-on-Data-Structures.
Following Operations can be performed on Data Structure:

<ul>
  <li>Searching</li>
  <li>Sorting</li>
  <li>Insertion</li>
  <li>Updation</li>
  <li>Deletion</li>
  <li>Transversal</li>
</ul>

<h3>A. Searching</h3>
You can perform a search for an array element based on its value or its index. This can be done using linear, binary search algorithms.

<h3>B. Sorting</h3>
Sorting is a process of ordering or placing a list of elements from a collection in some kind of order. Sorting can be done in ascending and descending order. It arranges the data in a sequence which makes searching easier.

<h3>C. Insertion</h3>
Insert operation is to insert one or more data elements into an array. This element can be added at start, middle or end of the array.

<h3>D. Updation</h3>
Update operation refers to updating an existing element from the array at a given index.

<h3>E. Deletion</h3>
Deletion refers to removing an existing element from the array and re-organizing all elements of an array.

<h3>F. Transversal</h3>
This operation is to traverse through the elements of an array.
